Using mostly imported 3D objects, editing them and placing them in a scene, a representation of an egyptian tomb has been created. 

The scene can be visualised by running Virtual Scene/ProiectPG/ProiectPG.exe. An initial animation presenting the main features will run first, during which no action can be taken. The viewer can move around the scene after the animation has ended using the 'W','A','S','D' keys (meaning Forward, Backward, Left and Right respectively) and the mouse. 

***Depending on the hardware used, there can be significant performance differences. Older computers may experience a low framerate and higher loading time. Sometimes, despite using up-to-date harware components, some operating systems may automatically run the application using the integrated graphic card (of the processor). This is almost guaranteed to lead to poor performance. For a better experience, use the dedicated graphic card (if there is any). This can be changed by accessing Graphic Settings (Windows) or Apple menu > System Preferences, click Battery, click the Battery tab, then deselect the automatic graphics switching checkbox (macOS). Select ProiectPG.exe and select the dedicated graphic card to run it.***

Additionally, the keys 'Q' and 'E' can be used to rotate the whole scene around a main axis. The keys 'H','J' and 'K' switch between the Solid, Wireframe and Point modes accordingly. The key 'P' can be used to activate the sarcophagus animation. 'Esc' can be used at any time to exit the program. 

More extensive information about the implementation can be found in the documentation.
